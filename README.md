### Entropy

[Claude Shannon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claude_Shannon) developed information entropy as a measure of the information content in a message, which is a measure of uncertainty reduced by the message. In so doing, he essentially invented the field of information theory.

Calculating the entropy of the password is a very reliable measure of its strength.
